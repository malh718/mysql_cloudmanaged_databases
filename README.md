Week 4 Homework Assignment: MySQL on Cloud Platforms - Azure and GCP


For the ERD for GCP, I created two tables. One called insuranceAETNA and one called Health Insurance Plan. In insuranceAETNA, I had insurance_ID and SCRIP. For HealthInsurancePlan I had insurance_ID, plan_name, Provider_name, date_enrolled, address, phone number and email. The foreign key that connects my two tables is insurance_id. And in the insuranceAETNA table the primary key is insurnace_ID.
